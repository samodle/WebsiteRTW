									<h3>Section 2. Specific Objectives and Purposes</h3>
									<p>The specific objectives and purposes of this corporation shall be:
 Recycle the World Inc. is a nonprofit corporation organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes, specifically to research new technologies to recycle all components of the waste stream, research conversion technologies that decrease or eliminate all need for landfills and create feedstocks for industry, and educate municipalities so that they can reduce or eliminate the need to send waste to landfills. We further our purpose under this program by conducting the following activities:	</p><p>
We will conduct research into recycling science and technology benefiting the environment and the health of our citizens. We will research alternative products and technologies that will enhance the value of the products that can be manufactured from the elements of the waste stream. The concentration of this research will be to develop new products that can be manufactured from each category of recoverable resource that will reduce the need for continual depletion of natural resources. i.e. digging ore, mining other natural resources and pumping oil from the ground. 	</p><p>
 We will educate municipalities on how to become landfill free and recycle all waste beneficially. The research will include the investigation into all aspects of the waste cycle so that we can teach municipalities, businesses and the general public how to modify their respective waste streams. We will design investigative studies to advance the concept of waste reuse and reduction. We will hire scientists, administrators, and teachers to go out and provide advice and overall education about waste reduction. We will be a resource for all waste generators so that beneficial reuse of the waste system becomes internalized and has a positive impact on the environment. 	</p><p>
We feel we can positively affect the environmental conditions that are associated with municipal solid waste. Landfills are environmental time bombs. They negatively affect the groundwater and cause greenhouse gas emissions. We can reduce or eliminate the landfills with specific research and education. This will benefit both the citizens of today and future generations. 	</p><p>
The overall direction of the organization will be performed by the officers and directors. Hired scientists and independent contractors will perform the studies as directed by the officers and directors. The organization will hire the required personnel to perform the duties and responsibilities as set forth by the officers and directors. This program will commence on April 1, 2017 and will consume 100% of the organization’s time.	</p><p>
Initially , the organization’s activities will be advertised through our educational activities and the general public will be notified and invited  to our educational seminars at the municipality level; and funded through grants and donations. Planning for our program is conducted at our headquarters listed above. The activities of the organization will be performed at the organizations business address. Hired activities will be performed at the respective facilities. Through the successful execution of our program, we further our charitable purposes.	</p><p>
The organization can expand and redefine its educational and scientific programs from time to time as necessary to meet the evolving challenges of the beneficial use of the ever changing waste streams and regulatory environment. </p>
